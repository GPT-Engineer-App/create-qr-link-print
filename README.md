# create-qr-link-print

I want to make a website that enables visitors to create QR codes. What sets this feature apart is that I want users to have the ability to modify the associated link of the QR code. Furthermore, I would like to integrate a printing service on my website so that visitors can conveniently have their QR codes printed.
